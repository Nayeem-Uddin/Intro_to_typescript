//we have to declare the value type with the variable
let surName:string = 'nayeem';
let age:number = 20;
let isAble:boolean = true; //it will give us the benefit whenever we want to console.log this variable the another benefit is that whenver anyone wants to use my code he/she can easily understand whether it is variable or function. and if it is variable then which type is this variable


const department:string = 'cse';
//department = 'eee' // we can't change as we know that if we declare anything as const then we can't change the value.
